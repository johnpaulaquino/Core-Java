Certainly! Here's a basic list of 15 array exercises in JavaScript:

1. Accessing Elements: Practice accessing elements at specific indices in arrays.

2. Modifying Elements: Modify elements in arrays by assigning new values to specific indices.

3. Adding Elements: Practice adding new elements to arrays using methods like push, unshift, or direct assignment.

4. Removing Elements: Practice removing elements from arrays using methods like pop, shift, splice, or direct assignment.

5. Concatenation: Combine two or more arrays into a single array using methods like concat.

6. Slicing: Extract a portion of an array into a new array using the slice method.

7. Searching: Search for elements within an array using methods like indexOf or find.

8. Filtering: Create a new array containing elements that satisfy a specific condition using methods like filter.

9. Mapping: Create a new array by transforming each element of an existing array using methods like map.

10. Sorting: Sort elements within an array using methods like sort.

11. Reversing: Reverse the order of elements within an array using methods like reverse.

12. Joining: Convert an array into a string by joining its elements using methods like join.

13. Iterating: Iterate over each element of an array using loops (e.g., for loop, forEach method).

14. Multi-dimensional Arrays: Work with arrays containing other arrays as elements, also known as multi-dimensional arrays.

15. Array Methods Exploration: Explore various built-in array methods in JavaScript, such as forEach, map, reduce, some, every, etc., and practice using them to manipulate arrays.
