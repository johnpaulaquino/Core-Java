Certainly! Here are 15 intermediate-level string exercises in JavaScript along with explanations:

1. Reverse a String: Write a function to reverse the characters in a string.

2. Count Vowels and Consonants: Create a function that counts the number of vowels and consonants in a string.

3. Palindrome Check: Write a function to check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

4. Capitalization: Write a function that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a sentence.

5. Word Frequency: Create a function that counts the frequency of each word in a sentence or paragraph.

6. Title Case: Write a function that converts a sentence to title case (capitalizes the first letter of each word).

7. Camel Case Conversion: Convert a dash/underscore delimited string into camelCase.

8. Character Frequency: Write a function to count the frequency of each character in a string.

9. Anagram Detection: Write a function to check if two strings are anagrams of each other (contain the same characters in any order).

10. Longest Word: Write a function that finds the longest word in a sentence.

11. String Compression: Implement a function to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters.

12. String Rotation: Write a function that checks if one string is a rotation of another (e.g., "waterbottle" is a rotation of "erbottlewat").

13. Substring Search: Implement a function to find all occurrences of a substring within a string.

14. Character Removal: Write a function that removes all occurrences of a specified character from a string.

15. String Interpolation: Implement a function that mimics string interpolation in JavaScript (e.g., "Hello {name}, welcome!" where {name} is replaced with a variable).

These exercises are designed to challenge your understanding of string manipulation techniques in JavaScript and cover a variety of common programming tasks involving strings.
