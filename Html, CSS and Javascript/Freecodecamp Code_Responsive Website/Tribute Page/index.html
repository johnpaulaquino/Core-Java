                <p>Elizabeth II (Elizabeth Alexandra Mary; 21 April 1926 â€“ 8 September 2022) 
                    was Queen of the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms from 6 February 
                    1952 until her death in 2022. She was queen regnant of 32 sovereign states over 
                    the course of her lifetime and remained the monarch of 15 realms by the 
                    time of her death. Her reign of 70 years and 214 days is the longest of any British
                     monarch or female monarch, and the second longest verified reign of any monarch of a 
                     sovereign state in history.</p>
                     <p>Elizabeth was born in Mayfair, London, during the reign of her 
                        paternal grandfather, King George V. She was the first child of the 
                        Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen 
                        Mother). Her father acceded to the throne in 1936 upon the abdication of his 
                        brother Edward VIII, making the ten-year-old Princess Elizabeth the heir 
                        presumptive. She was educated privately at home and began to undertake public
                         duties during the Second World War, serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. In November 1947, she married Philip Mountbatten, a former prince of Greece and Denmark, and their marriage lasted 73 years until his death in 2021. They had four children: 
                        Charles, Anne, Andrew, and Edward.</p>
